# MMObot
This is a simple bot for use in games or the office to automate menial and repetitive tasks 
It will record mouse and keyboard inputs, store it as a JSON file, and play the recorded actions from the JSON.
A GUI has been coded using tkinter to improve user friendliness.

## How to use
You must have Python installed on your machine. Download the scripts to folder and ensure you have a directory named "recordings" present for the JSON file.
Then simply run the GUI.py script and follow the on-screen directions. It should be noted that while I have added a recording of mouse movements it is not recommended 
that this function be used due to how slow it is.

## Notes
- Using this program may constitute cheating in certain video games, and could result in being banned. Use at your own discretion, I am not responsible for your lack of gray matter.
- I may come back to this project and add in mouse dragging and wrap it in a .exe to make it more user friendly.
